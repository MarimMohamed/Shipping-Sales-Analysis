Sales Data Cleaning and Exploratory Analysis

Overview
This project focuses on cleaning and analyzing a sales dataset to prepare it for further insights and business applications. The dataset contains detailed information about sales transactions, including order details, customer information, product categories, and geographic data. The primary goal is to clean the data, handle inconsistencies, and perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and trends in sales performance.

Project Objectives
Data Cleaning: Remove redundant columns, handle missing values, ensure proper data types, and eliminate duplicates to create a reliable dataset.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze sales trends across regions, categories, and time periods to identify key insights, such as top-performing regions or product categories.
Data Preparation: Transform raw data into a structured format suitable for advanced analysis or visualization.

Dataset
The dataset (train.csv) contains 9,800 entries with 18 columns, including:

Order Details: Order ID, Order Date, Ship Date, Ship Mode
Customer Information: Customer ID, Customer Name, Segment
Geographic Data: Country, City, State, Region, Postal Code
Product Information: Product ID, Category, Sub-Category, Product Name
Sales Metrics: Sales (in USD)

Key Features
Time-based Analysis: Order and shipping dates allow for temporal analysis.
Geographic Scope: Sales data spans multiple U.S. cities and states.
Product Categories: Includes Furniture, Office Supplies, and Technology.
Technologies Used
Python: Core programming language for data processing and analysis.
Pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning.
NumPy: For numerical operations.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization (e.g., heatmaps).
Jupyter Notebook: For interactive development and documentation.
