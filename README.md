## 🛍️ Sales Data Cleanup & Insights Hunt 🌟
This project focuses on cleaning and analyzing a sales dataset to prepare it for further insights and business applications. The dataset contains detailed information about sales transactions, including order details, customer information, product categories, and geographic data. The primary goal is to clean the data, handle inconsistencies, and perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and trends in sales performance.

# 🛠️ Tools I Used
Python 🐍
Pandas 📋
NumPy 🔢
Matplotlib & Seaborn 📊

# 📋 My Workflow
Here’s how I tackled this project:

1️⃣ Loaded the sales dataset with 9,800 rows of orders, customers, and products.

2️⃣ Checked the data’s structure and peeked at random samples to get the vibe.

3️⃣ Dropped the Postal Code column since it wasn’t adding much value.

4️⃣ Made sure there were no duplicates (clean slate, woo!).

5️⃣ Fixed Order Date and Ship Date to proper datetime formats and calculated shipping days.

6️⃣ Added columns for day, month, and year of orders to dig into trends.

7️⃣ Created a heatmap to explore sales by product category and region.

# 🚀 What’s Next?
Inshallah, I’m ready to level up Soon, I’ll build a super cool dashboard with Power BI to make these insights pop with interactive visuals!
